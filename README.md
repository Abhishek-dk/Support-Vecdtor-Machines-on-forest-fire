## Support Vector Machines(SVM) are powerful ML algorithm that are used for classification amd regression puroses.
SVM Classifier builds a model that assigns new datapoint to one of the given categories.
Thus ,It can be viewed as Non-Probabilistic binary Linear Classifier.
SVMs can efficiently perform a non-Linear classification using the Kernal Trick.It enable us to implicitly map the inputs into high dimentional feature spaces.
